        For me, to capture images and create graphics means to document fleeting
        moments in life that we usually don’t pay attention to. These moments could be
        anything at any time, anywhere and so when looking back at these photos, it 
        brings back the memories and feelings at that moment. My house is 10 minutes 
        walk from the bus stop I get off at, during the walk, I always find myself 
        raising my camera to take pictures. A picture of myself, checking out my outfit
        or just to see how bad my dark circle was. A picture of this random squirrel 
        climbing fences and running away from me. Or a picture of the sunset, how the 
        sky is painted with three different colors. Photography, to me, is a process of 
        oticing, appreciating, and engaging with the world around me.

        Suan Sontag’s “In Plato’s Cave” argues about how photography can be a double
        edged sword. Because the photographer chooses what to show in the images and 
        what to leave out, they can manipulate what message and emotion their image 
        wants to communicate to the viewers. As for my projects, I would like to 
        continue capturing moments from daily lives to create a narrative that is almost
        dreamlike. To achieve this, I need to experiment with lighting, composition, 
        and post-processing techniques that enhance the surreal quality of everyday 
        moments. And leave out details that would distract the audiences from the 
        illusion I’m trying to create. By selectively composing each image, I can
        evoke specific emotions like nostalgia, wonder, or mystery. This approach 
        aligns with Sontag’s idea that photography does not always reflect reality, 
        it's shaped by the photographer's choices.
