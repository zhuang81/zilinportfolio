        For the blue butterfly pattern, I started off with a reference photo of
        a chinese knot and took inspirations from there. Since the knot was red,
        I wanted to use a differnt color so the design doesn't resemble a
        chinese knot. I picked three colors from the monochromatic pallet then
        spinned the design around for it to resembele a butterfly. Lastly, I
        used the grid pattern and adjusted it so fits the background.

        For the green square pattern, I also started off with a volleyball as a
        reference. I wanted this pattern to be minimalistic and give a calm,
        balanced mood. So, I chose to use rectangles to create that minimalistic
        vibe and used color green to create a calm, peaceful mood.
