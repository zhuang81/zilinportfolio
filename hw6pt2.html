      <p>
        I chose this picture of bedroom becuase there's alot of layers to work
        with and I thought it would come out nice after illustrator. I started
        with tracing the bigger blocks using rectangles and color coded them
        into different categories (foreground, middle, back). Then I ajusted the
        layers so the blocks correctly appears on top of each other. I also
        notice there's light and shades in the picture, so I try to recreate the
        same effect by using a darker shade (of the three colors). There's alot
        more details I could've included but I didn't want too many shapes or it
        would be messy to look at.
