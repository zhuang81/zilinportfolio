      <p>
        I chose image because of its framing and leading lines. When I took this
        picture, I thought the surrounding buildings create a natural frame that
        draws the eye to the center of this photo. There's a clear division
        between the foreground , middle-ground and background emphasizing
        spatial depth, which I think makes the composition interesting. The sky
        and fog serve as negative space, preventing the image from feeling
        cluttered. The dark foreground elements contrast with the soft
        background, creating a balanced composition.
