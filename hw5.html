      <p>
        I have the text as a layer and the shapes on another layer. For the
        text, I use the pencil tool to draw paths. On the word "Broken", I made
        the letters look fractured to match with the meaning of the word and
        contrats with the background. And I also made the word "Bridge" look
        round off to contrast with its background. On the shape layer, I decided
        to use rectangles and cirles becuase they can represent money (this
        piece argues about economic division). I colored some shapes green and
        yellow to represent wealth and places them behind the text "Broken".
        Then i colored some shapes brown and dull red to represnet proverty, and
        places them behind the text "Bridge". This is meant to contrast with the
        text but complements with the background. The star shape meant to
        represent hope for reconnection of the two economic groups.
