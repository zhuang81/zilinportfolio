    This photomontage explores the experience of feeling isolated and
    emotionally drowned. As more and more people struggle with mental health,
    this issue becomes increasingly important for the public to know and
    understand. So I wanted to depict the feeling of being trapped, unable to
    escape overwhelming feelings.
  </p>
  <p>
    To achieve this effect, I picked four images from an online site: a dark
    room with a window, the sea, raindrops and a silhouette. I mainly used layer
    masks and blending modes to create this photo. For the sea layer, I used
    linear light to enhance the texture of the waves. For the room layer, I used
    a gradient mask layer to help blend the images smoothly with the sea layer.
    These two layers create the feeling of being trapped, as the only way to
    escape was through the window but the presence of water makes it seem
    impossible. To integrate the silhouette, I used a gradient mask layer again
    to crop out unnecessary details and used a darken blend. Lastly, I added a
    raindrops layer by using a lighter color blend and a gradient mask. The
    purpose of these two layers is to enforce the idea of being trapped, as if
    the viewer is trapped behind a foggy surface and the silhouette is unable to
    escape the room.

    This photomontage explores the theme of economic inequality, emphasizing the
    gap between rich and poor in current society. "The rich get richer and the
    poor get poorer" has become increasingly prevalent, the widening gap between
    the rich and the poor is a result of many economic issues. So I wanted to
    create a photo that reflects the idea of the increasing gap between these
    two groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    To achieve this effect, I picked five photos form an online site: a well maintained home and a
    worn down building, crumbled paper and ripped ends, two hands. I blended the
    images of the buildings using gradient masks, to create contrast and
    represent two distinct socio-economic backgrounds. I also blend in the
    crumbled paper using color burn with the worn down building to enhance the
    contrast and to add a layer of texture. Then I masked out the hands to
    symbolize the growing gap and separation of the two groups. To reinforce the
    idea of separation, I blended in the ripped ends using linear burn and
    placed it between the images of the two buildings.
